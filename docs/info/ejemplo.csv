Without assistive devices specifically prostheses, the quality of life of persons with lower limb amputation (PLLA) further deteriorates. Therefore, prostheses are fundamental to improving their quality of life. Objectives: This study aimed to establish the number of PLLA with or without prosthesis and to determine their socio-economic profile in Rwanda. Method: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in all sectors of Rwanda. As a result of coronavirus disease 2019 movement restrictions, data collection was carried out through telephone calls with participants to complete the questionnaires. Descriptive, inferential statistics and chi-square test were performed to analyse data using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) 21.0. Results: Of the 3026 participants identified countrywide, 68.8% were males and 60.3% of them did not have any prosthesis (p = 0.003). The majority (62.4%) of those who had prosthetic devices needed repair of their prostheses while 14.8% of participants reported that their prosthetic devices were completely broken and/or damaged (p = 0.604). Among the participants, 63.7% had no source of income and 66.7% had dependents (p <= 0.001). Conclusion: The majority of the PLLA in Rwanda did not have prosthetic devices and even those with prostheses did not fully function and thus required repair. Therefore, it adversely affects their livelihood. Contribution: The government should collaborate with stakeholders working with persons with disabilities and implement mechanisms and/or strategies to make prosthetic devices accessible and affordable.;;2223-9170;2226-7220;;DEC 9;2022;11;;;;;a1081;10.4102/ajod.v11i0.1081;http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/ajod.v11i0.1081;WOS:000905106800001

Martin; Miller, William C.";Mobility and Participation of People With Disabilities Using Mobility Assistive Technologies: Protocol for a Mixed-Methods Study;JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS;Background: Many community-dwelling individuals living with a disability use mobility assistive technologies (MATs). MAT devices are generally beneficial for individuals with mobility impairments. However, less is known about the specific factors that may foster or deter mobility and community participation. Objective: The purpose of this protocol is to describe the methodology for a study including three main objectives: (1) to understand the places people using MAT go and the things they do, (2) to identify perceived barriers and facilitators as well as users' desired environmental modifications, and (3) to understand subjective and objective issues related to environmental accessibility. Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted in Vancouver and in Quebec City. Qualitative interviews were conducted to address all three objectives. In addition, Objective 1 was achieved through collection of global positioning system (GPS) data and activity diaries with 36 participants per site who represented six types of MAT users (ie, cane, walker, crutches, manual wheelchair, power wheelchair, and scooter). All participants were invited to take part in all aspects of data collection. PhotoVoice was used to address Objectives 2 and 3. Two environmental audits were used to address Objective 2. The Stakeholders' Walkability/Wheelability Audit in Neighbourhood (SWAN) measured perceptions related to a variety of community environmental features associated with mobility and participation. A total of 24 participants were recruited to each study site for SWAN data collection. The Measure of Environmental Accessibility (MEA) was also used to objectively measure access to exterior and interior environments selected earlier in the project by the participants that could benefit from improvements. Results: Funding for this study was obtained from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Approval was obtained from the University of British Columbia Research Ethics Board and the Centre integre universitaire de sante et de services sociaux de la Capitale-Nationale Research Ethics Board. Regarding the MEA evaluations, 19 locations (ie, buildings and exterior spaces) where obstacles have been identified by the participants of the PhotoVoice focus groups have been evaluated in Quebec City and 20 locations have been identified in the Vancouver region by the participants of the community forums. Data collection for this project was completed in December 2018. Analysis and writing of manuscripts are underway. Conclusions: The use of a variety of methods to gather data on participation and mobility will allow a more holistic consideration of factors influencing mobility with a MAT device. This study will provide objective information about the mobility of participants and identify barriers and facilitators that impact their mobility and community participation. Through the mixed-methods approach employed in this study, we will gain a subjective evaluation of the participants' neighborhoods, including personally meaningful information on environmental features that influence participants' everyday mobility and participation. We will also gain an objective evaluation of particular obstacles that community users of MAT identify as significant barriers to their ability to access public environments. We anticipate that these findings will help to identify a broad spectrum of solutions to improve the mobility and community participation of MAT users.;"Mortenson, W Ben/0000-0002-0183-6163; Miller, William/0000-0003-3060-0210; Chaudhury, Habib/0000-0001-5770-3776; Routhier, Francois/0000-0002-5458-6233; MARTIN GINIS, KATHLEEN/0000-0002-7076-3594";1929-0748;;;APR;2019;8;4;;;;e12089;10.2196/12089;http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/12089;WOS:000466496800035
J;"Naidoo, V; Putnam, M; Spindel, A";"Naidoo, Vishaya; Putnam, Michelle; Spindel, Andria";Key focal areas for bridging the fields of aging and disability: findings from the growing older with a disability conference;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED CARE;Based upon research presented at the 2011 Festival of International Conferences on Caregiving, Disability, Aging and Technology (FICCDAT)-and specifically the Growing Older with a Disability (GOWD) conference, this paper identifies areas where bridging building between aging and disability is needed to support older adults aging into or with disabilities. Five focal areas emerged: 1) The Need to Forward Bridging Between Aging and Disability Sectors, 2) Theoretical Frameworks of Individual Aging that Facilitate Bridging, 3) Bridging through Consumer Participation and Involvement, 4) Bridging Through Knowledge Transfer and 5) Bridging Opportunities in Long-Term Supports and Services and Assistive Technologies. Discussion of themes is provided within both international and Canadian contexts, reflecting the interests of FICCDAT and GOWD organizers in discussing how to improve bridging in Canada.

The World Health Organization recommends at least 150-300 minutes of moderate -intensity or 75-150 minutes of vigorous -intensity aerobic PA per week to reduce the risks of chronic disease. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of conventional PR versus web -based PR with respect to changes in PA. Methods: Patients with COPD were randomized to either conventional PR classes (n=51) or a web -based PR program (n=52) for 7 weeks in a feasibility study. Accelerometers (Sensewear) were worn before and after the intervention, and PA was measured as steps per day and mean bouts of moderate activity for >= 2, >= 5, >= 10, and >= 20 minutes. Measures were derived for patients with >= 8 hours of data per day for >= 4 days, using the R package for statistical analysis. Variables were explored to examine their relationships with bouts of activity. Results: Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between groups. Complete PA data were available for the groups receiving web -based (n=20) and conventional (n=34) PR interventions. The web -based PR group demonstrated a nonsignificant increase in the number of steps per day, which mainly comprised short bouts of moderate to vigorous intensity PA when compared to the conventional PR group (P=.20). The conventional PR group demonstrated increased 20 -minute bouts of PA by 49.1%, although this was not significant (P=.07). At baseline, age (r=-0.21, P=.04), BMI (r=-0.311, P=.004), and FEV1(forced expiratory volume in 1 second; % predicted; r=-0.248, P=.048) were significantly correlated with 10 -minute bouts of PA; however, this was not observed post intervention. Conclusions: The analysis revealed a nonsignificant difference in the pattern of PA between groups receiving conventional vs web -based PR-the former being associated with an increase in 20 -minute bouts, while the latter having demonstrated an increase in the number of steps per day. There appears to be a differing response emerging between the two interventions.";"Newby, Chris/0000-0002-2936-8592; Chaplin, Emma/0000-0003-0981-2980; Houchen-Wolloff, Linzy/0000-0003-4940-8835";;2369-2529;;JAN-MAR;2022;9;1;;;;e28875;10.2196/28875;http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/28875;WOS:001207095800003

Chris";Mapping upper-limb motor performance after stroke - a novel method with utility for individualized motor training;JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION;Background: Chronic upper limb motor impairment is a common outcome of stroke. Therapeutic training can reduce motor impairment. Recently, a growing interest in evaluating motor training provided by robotic assistive devices has emerged. Robot-assisted therapy is attractive because it provides a means of increasing practice intensity without increasing the workload of physical therapists. However, movements practised through robotic assistive devices are commonly pre-defined and fixed across individuals. More optimal training may result from individualizing the selection of the trained movements based on the individual's impairment profile. This requires quantitative assessment of the degree of the motor impairment prior to training, in relevant movement tasks. However, standard clinical measures for profiling motor impairment after stroke are often subjective and lack precision. We have developed a novel robot-mediated method for systematic and fine-grained mapping (or profiling) of individual performance across a wide range of planar arm reaching movements. Here we describe and demonstrate this mapping method and its utilization for individualized training. We also present a novel principle for the individualized selection of training movements based on the performance maps. Methods and Results: To demonstrate the utility of our method we present examples of 2D performance maps produced from the kinetic and kinematics data of two individuals with stroke-related upper limb hemiparesis. The maps outline distinct regions of high motor impairment. The procedure of map-based selection of training movements and the change in motor performance following training is demonstrated for one participant. Conclusions: The performance mapping method is feasible to produce (online or offline). The 2D maps are easy to interpret and to be utilized for selecting individual performance-based training. Different performance maps can be easily compared within and between individuals, which potentially has diagnostic utility.;"Punt, David/0000-0003-2384-3193; Wing, Alan/0000-0002-2623-3801";1743-0003;;;DEC 6;2017;14;;;;;127;10.1186/s12984-017-0335-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12984-017-0335-x;WOS:000417076800001
J;Freckmann, G;Freckmann, G.;New technologies in diabetology. How far are we from a closed loop?;INTERNIST;Today, assistive technologies are highly important in the treatment of diabetes, especially in the therapy of type 1 diabetes. The use of insulin pumps, for example, has become an established form of treatment. Modern insulin pumps offer various functions, such as different basal rate profiles, split delivery of the meal bolus, and integrated bolus calculators. Some pumps are additionally connected to a blood glucose meter or a continuous glucose-monitoring sensor. Several minimally invasive needle-type sensor systems for continuous tissue glucose monitoring are already available. Recent developments aim at increasing the functionality of insulin pumps and the improvements of sensors for continuous glucose monitoring. In addition, many research groups are working on closing the loop between these two components and thus developing an artificial pancreas, which automatically regulates insulin delivery. The first steps have already been taken and bolus calculators or sensor-augmented insulin pumps with suspension of insulin delivery are now available. Many experimental models show promising results. Prior to the implementation of a fully automated system for everyday use, however, partially automated systems that require user input are to be expected. This article aims at giving an overview of the current state of development in the field of diabetes technology.;Freckmann, Guido/0000-0002-0406-9529;0020-9554;1432-1289;;MAY;2015;56;5;;484;492;;10.1007/s00108-014-3627-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00108-014-3627-2;WOS:000353785200003
