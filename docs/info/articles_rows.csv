J;"Ngarambe, R; Sagahutu, JB; Nuhu, A; Tumusiime, DK";"Ngarambe, Robert; Sagahutu, Jean Baptiste; Nuhu, Assuman; Tumusiime, David K.";The status and use of prosthetic devices by persons with lower limb amputation in Rwanda;AFRICAN JOURNAL OF DISABILITY;Background: Amputation is one of the leading causes of disabilities because of reduced mobility. Without assistive devices specifically prostheses, the quality of life of persons with lower limb amputation (PLLA) further deteriorates. Therefore, prostheses are fundamental to improving their quality of life. Objectives: This study aimed to establish the number of PLLA with or without prosthesis and to determine their socio-economic profile in Rwanda. Method: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in all sectors of Rwanda. As a result of coronavirus disease 2019 movement restrictions, data collection was carried out through telephone calls with participants to complete the questionnaires. Descriptive, inferential statistics and chi-square test were performed to analyse data using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) 21.0. Results: Of the 3026 participants identified countrywide, 68.8% were males and 60.3% of them did not have any prosthesis (p = 0.003). The majority (62.4%) of those who had prosthetic devices needed repair of their prostheses while 14.8% of participants reported that their prosthetic devices were completely broken and/or damaged (p = 0.604). Among the participants, 63.7% had no source of income and 66.7% had dependents (p <= 0.001). Conclusion: The majority of the PLLA in Rwanda did not have prosthetic devices and even those with prostheses did not fully function and thus required repair. Therefore, it adversely affects their livelihood. Contribution: The government should collaborate with stakeholders working with persons with disabilities and implement mechanisms and/or strategies to make prosthetic devices accessible and affordable.;;2223-9170;2226-7220;;DEC 9;2022;11;;;;;a1081;10.4102/ajod.v11i0.1081;http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/ajod.v11i0.1081;WOS:000905106800001

Martin; Miller, William C.";Mobility and Participation of People With Disabilities Using Mobility Assistive Technologies: Protocol for a Mixed-Methods Study;JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS;Background: Many community-dwelling individuals living with a disability use mobility assistive technologies (MATs). MAT devices are generally beneficial for individuals with mobility impairments. However, less is known about the specific factors that may foster or deter mobility and community participation. Objective: The purpose of this protocol is to describe the methodology for a study including three main objectives: (1) to understand the places people using MAT go and the things they do, (2) to identify perceived barriers and facilitators as well as users' desired environmental modifications, and (3) to understand subjective and objective issues related to environmental accessibility. Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted in Vancouver and in Quebec City. Qualitative interviews were conducted to address all three objectives. In addition, Objective 1 was achieved through collection of global positioning system (GPS) data and activity diaries with 36 participants per site who represented six types of MAT users (ie, cane, walker, crutches, manual wheelchair, power wheelchair, and scooter). All participants were invited to take part in all aspects of data collection. PhotoVoice was used to address Objectives 2 and 3. Two environmental audits were used to address Objective 2. The Stakeholders' Walkability/Wheelability Audit in Neighbourhood (SWAN) measured perceptions related to a variety of community environmental features associated with mobility and participation. A total of 24 participants were recruited to each study site for SWAN data collection. The Measure of Environmental Accessibility (MEA) was also used to objectively measure access to exterior and interior environments selected earlier in the project by the participants that could benefit from improvements. Results: Funding for this study was obtained from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Approval was obtained from the University of British Columbia Research Ethics Board and the Centre integre universitaire de sante et de services sociaux de la Capitale-Nationale Research Ethics Board. Regarding the MEA evaluations, 19 locations (ie, buildings and exterior spaces) where obstacles have been identified by the participants of the PhotoVoice focus groups have been evaluated in Quebec City and 20 locations have been identified in the Vancouver region by the participants of the community forums. Data collection for this project was completed in December 2018. Analysis and writing of manuscripts are underway. Conclusions: The use of a variety of methods to gather data on participation and mobility will allow a more holistic consideration of factors influencing mobility with a MAT device. This study will provide objective information about the mobility of participants and identify barriers and facilitators that impact their mobility and community participation. Through the mixed-methods approach employed in this study, we will gain a subjective evaluation of the participants' neighborhoods, including personally meaningful information on environmental features that influence participants' everyday mobility and participation. We will also gain an objective evaluation of particular obstacles that community users of MAT identify as significant barriers to their ability to access public environments. We anticipate that these findings will help to identify a broad spectrum of solutions to improve the mobility and community participation of MAT users.;"Mortenson, W Ben/0000-0002-0183-6163; Miller, William/0000-0003-3060-0210; Chaudhury, Habib/0000-0001-5770-3776; Routhier, Francois/0000-0002-5458-6233; MARTIN GINIS, KATHLEEN/0000-0002-7076-3594";1929-0748;;;APR;2019;8;4;;;;e12089;10.2196/12089;http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/12089;WOS:000466496800035

The World Health Organization recommends at least 150-300 minutes of moderate -intensity or 75-150 minutes of vigorous -intensity aerobic PA per week to reduce the risks of chronic disease. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of conventional PR versus web -based PR with respect to changes in PA. Methods: Patients with COPD were randomized to either conventional PR classes (n=51) or a web -based PR program (n=52) for 7 weeks in a feasibility study. Accelerometers (Sensewear) were worn before and after the intervention, and PA was measured as steps per day and mean bouts of moderate activity for >= 2, >= 5, >= 10, and >= 20 minutes. Measures were derived for patients with >= 8 hours of data per day for >= 4 days, using the R package for statistical analysis. Variables were explored to examine their relationships with bouts of activity. Results: Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between groups. Complete PA data were available for the groups receiving web -based (n=20) and conventional (n=34) PR interventions. The web -based PR group demonstrated a nonsignificant increase in the number of steps per day, which mainly comprised short bouts of moderate to vigorous intensity PA when compared to the conventional PR group (P=.20). The conventional PR group demonstrated increased 20 -minute bouts of PA by 49.1%, although this was not significant (P=.07). At baseline, age (r=-0.21, P=.04), BMI (r=-0.311, P=.004), and FEV1(forced expiratory volume in 1 second; % predicted; r=-0.248, P=.048) were significantly correlated with 10 -minute bouts of PA; however, this was not observed post intervention. Conclusions: The analysis revealed a nonsignificant difference in the pattern of PA between groups receiving conventional vs web -based PR-the former being associated with an increase in 20 -minute bouts, while the latter having demonstrated an increase in the number of steps per day. There appears to be a differing response emerging between the two interventions.";"Newby, Chris/0000-0002-2936-8592; Chaplin, Emma/0000-0003-0981-2980; Houchen-Wolloff, Linzy/0000-0003-4940-8835";;2369-2529;;JAN-MAR;2022;9;1;;;;e28875;10.2196/28875;http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/28875;WOS:001207095800003

Chris";Mapping upper-limb motor performance after stroke - a novel method with utility for individualized motor training;JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION;Background: Chronic upper limb motor impairment is a common outcome of stroke. Therapeutic training can reduce motor impairment. Recently, a growing interest in evaluating motor training provided by robotic assistive devices has emerged. Robot-assisted therapy is attractive because it provides a means of increasing practice intensity without increasing the workload of physical therapists. However, movements practised through robotic assistive devices are commonly pre-defined and fixed across individuals. More optimal training may result from individualizing the selection of the trained movements based on the individual's impairment profile. This requires quantitative assessment of the degree of the motor impairment prior to training, in relevant movement tasks. However, standard clinical measures for profiling motor impairment after stroke are often subjective and lack precision. We have developed a novel robot-mediated method for systematic and fine-grained mapping (or profiling) of individual performance across a wide range of planar arm reaching movements. Here we describe and demonstrate this mapping method and its utilization for individualized training. We also present a novel principle for the individualized selection of training movements based on the performance maps. Methods and Results: To demonstrate the utility of our method we present examples of 2D performance maps produced from the kinetic and kinematics data of two individuals with stroke-related upper limb hemiparesis. The maps outline distinct regions of high motor impairment. The procedure of map-based selection of training movements and the change in motor performance following training is demonstrated for one participant. Conclusions: The performance mapping method is feasible to produce (online or offline). The 2D maps are easy to interpret and to be utilized for selecting individual performance-based training. Different performance maps can be easily compared within and between individuals, which potentially has diagnostic utility.;"Punt, David/0000-0003-2384-3193; Wing, Alan/0000-0002-2623-3801";1743-0003;;;DEC 6;2017;14;;;;;127;10.1186/s12984-017-0335-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12984-017-0335-x;WOS:000417076800001
J;Freckmann, G;Freckmann, G.;New technologies in diabetology. How far are we from a closed loop?;INTERNIST;Today, assistive technologies are highly important in the treatment of diabetes, especially in the therapy of type 1 diabetes. The use of insulin pumps, for example, has become an established form of treatment. Modern insulin pumps offer various functions, such as different basal rate profiles, split delivery of the meal bolus, and integrated bolus calculators. Some pumps are additionally connected to a blood glucose meter or a continuous glucose-monitoring sensor. Several minimally invasive needle-type sensor systems for continuous tissue glucose monitoring are already available. Recent developments aim at increasing the functionality of insulin pumps and the improvements of sensors for continuous glucose monitoring. In addition, many research groups are working on closing the loop between these two components and thus developing an artificial pancreas, which automatically regulates insulin delivery. The first steps have already been taken and bolus calculators or sensor-augmented insulin pumps with suspension of insulin delivery are now available. Many experimental models show promising results. Prior to the implementation of a fully automated system for everyday use, however, partially automated systems that require user input are to be expected. This article aims at giving an overview of the current state of development in the field of diabetes technology.;Freckmann, Guido/0000-0002-0406-9529;0020-9554;1432-1289;;MAY;2015;56;5;;484;492;;10.1007/s00108-014-3627-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00108-014-3627-2;WOS:000353785200003

The Assistive Product List is a comprehensive list of products identified as essential for access through universal health coverage. Key stakeholders, including organisations of persons with disabilities, civil service organisations, academic organisations and government ministries are collaborating to integrate assistive technology into policy and develop a priority assistive products list for Malawi. Objective To understand the organisational characteristics of, and assistive products provided by, key stakeholders working in AT in Malawi. Study Design Online survey of representatives from key stakeholder organisations. Methods We surveyed representatives of key stakeholder organisations to gather information regarding assistive technology product and service provision in Malawi. Responses were analysed using counts for closed-ended questions, and conventional content analysis for open-ended questions. Results A total of 36 of the 50 APL products were provided by eight organisations. Related services were provided for 36 of the 50 APL products by twelve organisations. Five organisations reported providing both products and services. Products and services are largely funded by donation and provided free to those who require them. Conclusion A range of organisations in Malawi play a role in assistive product delivery and related services.

J;"Higgins, H; Gupta, N";"Higgins, Heather; Gupta, Neeru";Characterizing social and policy determinants of hospital length of stay among paediatric inpatients with diabetes using linked population-based data;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POPULATION DATA SCIENCE (IJPDS);Background Evidence is limited on the non-medical factors influencing hospital length of stay (LOS) among paediatric inpatients with diabetes, notably potential social and policy correlates. This study aimed to characterize the associations of socioeconomic status and health policy environment with diabetes-attributable LOS to help inform accountability monitoring of a provincial comprehensive diabetes strategy aiming to minimize time in hospital among this high-risk population. Data and methods This retrospective population-based study drew on multiple linked administrative and geospatial databases among all children aged 18 and under with a diabetes-related hospitalization in the province of New Brunswick, Canada, during the four-year period following implementation of an insulin pump funding program. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the role of access to the public insulin pump resourcing scheme and relative neighbourhood deprivation as predictors of days spent in acute care, controlling for age, sex, and place of residence. Results Among the paediatric inpatient population (N =386), 21% had accessed social resources made available through the insulin pump funding policy and 42% resided in the most materially deprived neighbourhoods. Diabetes-related hospital stays averaged 3.87 days. Paediatric inpatients having accessed resources through the social insurance policy spent significantly fewer days in hospital (1.34 days less [95% CI: 0.63-2.05]) than those who had not, all else being equal. Observed differences in LOS by neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation were not found to be statistically significant in the multivariate analysis. Conclusion Findings from this context of universal medical coverage suggested that public policy for supplemental financing of assistive technologies among children with diabetes may be associated with reduced burden to the hospital system. The causes of socioenvironmental disparities in LOS require further investigation to inform interventions to mitigate preventable patient-level variations in hospital-based health outcomes.;;;2399-4908;;;2021;6;1;;;;6:1:22;10.23889/ijpds.v6i1.1678;http://dx.doi.org/10.23889/ijpds.v6i1.1678;WOS:000894823500032
J;Sriwisathiyakun, K;Sriwisathiyakun, Kanyarat;A MOOC-INTEGRATED DESIGN THINKING MODEL FOR HEARING-IMPAIRED LEARNERS;JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH;Aim/Purpose This study aims to introduce an innovative approach to improving learning outcomes for hearing-impaired learners (HL) within inclusive education settings. By integrating design thinking principles into Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) specifically designed for HL, this research seeks to address their unique educational needs. The study examines the components of a design thinking model within MOOCs for HL and evaluates the effectiveness of the pilot course in enhancing their learning experience and achieving the required test scores. Background The persistent educational disparities faced by HL necessitate innovative solutions within inclusive education. By employing a design thinking approach, educational tools were developed specifically for these learners, with the empathy phase profoundly understanding and addressing their unique needs and desires. This study aims to bridge this gap by leveraging design thinking principles and MOOCs tailored for HL alongside instructional strategies and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) techniques. Methodology The study unfolds in three primary phases: Model Development, Model Assessment, and Model Piloting. In the Model Development phase, design thinking principles are integrated with Thai MOOC development, instructional strategies, and UDL techniques to create the initial model. The Model Assessment phase involves expert evaluations to validate and refine the model based on their feedback. Finally, in the Model Piloting phase, the refined model is tested with learners, and assessments are conducted to evaluate its practical applicability and effectiveness in a real-world setting. Contribution This research contributes significantly to reducing educational inequalities and advancing inclusive education. By introducing a model that integrates design thinking principles into MOOCs tailored for HL, it promotes lifelong learning opportunities and aligns with broader societal efforts to address educational dis- parities. Findings Key findings from the study include the development of a comprehensive six- stage model and its essential co-components, which received high suitability rat- ings from expert evaluations. The model's application resulted in an impressive pass rate among learners, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing learning outcomes. These results demonstrate the model's potential to impact inclusive education significantly by providing a scalable and effective framework for inte- grating design thinking into MOOC development. Furthermore, it creates courses that effectively meet the diverse needs of learners, ensuring accessibility and improved learning experiences for all. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers Practitioners should adopt design thinking and UDL principles in MOOC de- velopment, ensuring courses are tailored to HL needs. Engage HL communities for relevant feedback and focus on accessibility with assistive technologies. Im- plement scalable solutions for broader impact and regularly assess course effec- tiveness to promote lifelong learning opportunities. Researchers should continue to explore and refine the developed model, con- sidering its application across diverse educational contexts and populations. Collaboration with HL communities and stakeholders can provide valuable in- sights for enhancing the effectiveness of inclusive education interventions. Impact on Society The integration of design thinking principles into MOOCs tailored for HL has a profound impact on society by promoting equal educational opportunities and lifelong learning. By addressing educational disparities, this research contributes to creating a more inclusive and equitable society. Future Research Future research could focus on longitudinal studies to assess the long-term im- pact of the model for HL. Additionally, exploring innovative technologies and pedagogical approaches can enhance the effectiveness of inclusive education in- terventions. Collaborative research efforts across disciplines can advance the field of inclusive education and foster continuous improvement in learning out- comes for diverse populations.;Sriwisathiyakun, Kanyarat/0000-0002-4533-6400;1547-9714;1539-3585;;;2024;23;;;;;23;10.28945/5368;http://dx.doi.org/10.28945/5368;WOS:001312611200001

However, since normally fNIRS hemodynamic response shows a long delay, we investigated new features, involving slope indicators, in order to immediately detect changes in the signals. Moreover, Common Spatial Patterns (CSPs) have been applied to both EEG and fNIRS signals. 15 healthy subjects took part in the experiments and since 25 trials per class were available, CSPs have been regularized with information from the entire population of participants and optimized using genetic algorithms.

However, existing works predominantly focus on performance-related measures for evaluating control systems as the subjective experience of a user by large cannot be directly observed. In this study, we therefore focus on agency-related interactions between control and embodiment in the context of physical human-machine interaction. By applying an intentional binding paradigm in a virtual, machine-assisted reaching task, we evaluate how the sense of agency of able-bodied humans is modulated by assistive force characteristics of a physically coupled device. In addition to measuring how assistive force profiles influence the sense of agency with intentional binding, we analyzed the sense of agency using a questionnaire. Remarkably, our participants reported to experience stronger agency when being appropriately assisted, although they contributed less to the control task. This is substantiated by the overall consistency of intentional binding results and the self-reported sense of agency. Our results confirm the fundamental feasibility of the sense of agency to objectively evaluate the quality of human-in-the-loop control for assistive technologies. While the underlying mechanisms causing the perceptual bias observed in the intentional binding paradigm are still to be understood, we believe that this study distinctly contributes to demonstrating how the sense of agency characterizes intuitiveness of assistance in physical human-machine interaction.;;1662-5161;;;MAY 8;2020;14;;;;;114;10.3389/fnhum.2020.00114;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00114;WOS:000536781000001

However, round-the-clock assistance and support are essential after discharge from hospitals or nursing homes. This inspired us to develop a round-the-clock rehabilitation-cum-assistance system operated by eye gazes of locked-in patients. To do this, we aimed to identify the essential daily activities of living for locked-in patients and represent these activities using the most universally acceptable icons/images on the interface for the rehabilitation-cum-assistance system. Method: Activities were selected from available conventions and literature with advice from a local physiotherapy centre. Simple arithmetic averages and weighted averages of recognition rates for different icons representing different daily activities were calculated as per ISO 3864. Universal acceptability of the icons was compared based on responses from 72 locked-in patients across five different age groups. The final icons or images were then selected. Results: Three icons were categorized as identifiable with overall average recognition rates above 66.7%. Icons with average recognition rates 30-60% were considered to have medium recognisability and 21 icons were in this category. The average recognition rates of six icons were below 30% and were not acceptable. An overall recognition efficiency of 91% was achieved for participants from all age groups. Conclusions: The most preferred and unambiguous icons or images representing the essential daily activities of living were identified for use on the interface of our rehabilitation-cum-assistance system for round-the-clock operation. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Performing some of the daily activities by locked-in patients himself/herself is essential for self-independence as well as measures the level of regular improvement. Assistive technologies have huge potential for application for the purpose, especially the vision-based systems. Present technology is useful for development of a vision-based rehabilitation-cum-assistance system for 24 x 7 assistance for the locked-in patients.

Central to the role of assistive technology to support and enhance quality of life is the development of non-obtrusive technologies. Despite the importance of non-obtrusiveness to the design of assistive technologies, there remains no standard definition of obtrusiveness or measurement instrument. A conceptual framework for obtrusiveness in home telehealth technologies has recently been proposed but has not yet been tested empirically. This project performed a secondary analysis of focus group and interview data to explore the presence of the dimensions of the obtrusiveness framework in older adults' responses to information-based assistive technologies in residential care facilities. We found the existing data contained examples of each dimension (physical, usability, privacy, function, human interaction, self-concept, routine, and sustainability) and 16 of the 22 subcategories proposed by the obtrusiveness framework. These results provide general support for the framework, although further prospective validation research is needed.

This article uses survey data and statistical modeling to explore differences in technology usage across disability subpopulations. Responses to a 2005 survey of nearly 2,000 adult consumers of California Independent Living Centers reveal large differences in technology usage by age, race, ethnicity, education, income, and type and severity of disability. Statistical modeling of overall device usage, number of devices used, and usage of high-, medium-, and low-tech devices reveals several factors that appear to put people with disabilities at a disadvantage in accessing and using assistive devices. These factors include lower educational attainment, racial or ethnic minority status, lower household income, later disability onset, and disability related to mental as opposed to physical or sensory functioning. Findings highlight approaches needed to expand usage of and to promote equal access to technologies that enable greater social and economic participation for people with disabilities.;Kaye, H Stephen/0000-0003-2920-3007;1040-0435;;;WIN;2008;20;4;;194;203;;10.1080/10400435.2008.10131946;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10400435.2008.10131946;WOS:000261938400002

Assistive devices can be a solution to training intensively at home. This qualitative study investigated stroke survivors' experiences regarding training using the hoMEcare aRm rehabiLItatioN (MERLIN) system, an assistive device and telecare platform. We investigated patients' perspectives regarding the home-based training with the MERLIN system, on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) domains and the facilitators and barriers of the MERLIN system. Methods Eleven patients in the chronic phase of stroke who completed the MERLIN trial took part in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were analysed using the framework method. Results Participants were in general positive about the device and the training. Several experienced positive effects on ICF body functions, such as joint range of motion and self-confidence. Some experienced improvements in activities, but not on participation level. Home training had advantages: flexibility in training time and duration and no need to travel. The major barriers were technical hard- and software issues and ergonomic complaints. A list of recommendations regarding assistive devices and home-based rehabilitation was created. Conclusions Homebased training using an assistive device was well received by stroke patients to train their upper limb function. Future device developers should take patients' feedback into account to overcome the barriers related to the introduction of new assistive devices at home. Our recommendations may be the first step to implementing patients' perspectives during the early stages of device development.;"van der Sluis, Corry K./0000-0003-2141-8214; Rozevink, Samantha/0000-0002-4992-1578";1748-3107;1748-3115;;APR 2;2024;19;3;;730;738;;10.1080/17483107.2022.2120641;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17483107.2022.2120641;WOS:000859148000001

This paper provides an overview of characteristics, risk factors, possible mechanisms, and management strategies for cognitive dysfunction in post-COVID-19 condition (PCC).Prolonged cognitive dysfunction is one of the most common impairments in PCC, affecting between 17% and 28% of the individuals more than 12 weeks after the infection and persisting in some cases for several years. Cognitive dysfunctions can be manifested as a wide range of symptoms including memory impairment, attention deficit, executive dysfunction, and reduced processing speed. Risk factors for developing PCC, with or without cognitive impairments, include advanced age, preexisting medical conditions, and the severity of acute illness. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear, but proposed contributors include neuroinflammation, hypoxia, vascular damage, and latent virus reactivation not excluding the possibility of direct viral invasion of the central nervous system, illustrating complex viral pathology.As the individual variation of the cognitive impairments is large, a neuropsychological examination and a person-centered multidimensional approach are required. According to the World Health Organization, limited evidence on COVID-19-related cognitive impairments necessitates implementing rehabilitation interventions from established practices of similar conditions. Psychoeducation and compensatory skills training are recommended. Assistive products and environmental modifications adapted to individual needs might be helpful. In specific attention- and working memory dysfunctions, cognitive training-carefully monitored for intensity-might be effective for people who do not suffer from post-exertional malaise. Further research is crucial for evidence-based interventions specific to COVID-19-related cognitive impairments. image;Moller, Marika/0000-0001-8700-5186;0954-6820;1365-2796;;NOV;2023;294;5;;563;581;;10.1111/joim.13720;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joim.13720;WOS:001074081200001

Ethical debates indicate various challenges. An important part of the ethical evaluation is to understand how users interact with these devices and how interaction influences users' perceptions and their ability to express themselves. In this review, we report and critically appraise findings of non-comparative empirical studies with regard to these effects from an ethical perspective.Electronic databases and other sources were queried using a comprehensive search strategy generating 9851 records. Studies were screened independently by two authors. Methodological quality of studies was assessed. For 22 reports on 21 datasets using a non-comparative design a narrative synthesis was performed.Data shows positive findings in regard to attitudes and emotional reactions of users. Varying perception of a social relation and social presence are the most commonly observed traits of interaction. Users struggle with understanding technical complexities while functionality of the devices is limited. This leads to a behavioral alignment of users towards the requirements of the devices to be able to make use of them.This evidence adds to three important ethical debates on the use of socially assistive devices in healthcare in regard to (1) reliability of existing empirical evidence to inform normative judgements, (2) ethical significance of the social presence of devices and (3) user autonomy in regard to behavioral alignment.;Haltaufderheide, Joschka/0000-0002-5014-4593;1353-3452;1471-5546;;FEB;2023;29;1;;;;5;10.1007/s11948-022-00419-9;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11948-022-00419-9;WOS:000924757300001

However, only a few quantitative studies have been performed to compare upper and lower extremity weight bearing. The aim of this study was to evaluate forearm and foot weight bearing using a FWW-AR and the effect of the armrest height. Methods: Eleven elderly women (mean age 80.1 +/- 5.3 years; mean height 148.5 +/- 4.0 cm; mean weight 51.2 +/- 9.0 kg) were enrolled. The subjects walked with an FWW-AR, with the elbow in either 90 degree (D90) or 130 degree (D130) flexion, for a distance of 10 m. Surface electromyographic signals were recorded for the upper, middle, and lower trapezius, anterior deltoid, and erector spinae muscles; walking velocity was measured with the subjects weight bearing on their feet and forearms while walking. Simultaneously, the maximum plantar and forearm loads during walking with an FWW-AR were measured. Results: The normalized foot plantar loads were lower at D90 than at D130, while the normalized forearm load was higher at D90 than at D130 (all P<0.05; left foot, 7.9 +/- 0.1 N/kg versus 8.8 +/- 0.1 N/kg; right foot, 8.6 +/- 0.2 N/kg versus. 9.6 +/- 0.1 N/kg; left forearm, 1.8 +/- 0.5 N/kg versus 0.8 +/- 0.2 N/kg; and right forearm, 2.0 +/- 0.5 N/kg versus 1.0 +/- 0.2 N/kg, respectively). The surface electromyographic activity of the muscles involved in shoulder elevation and the walking velocity were both lower with the elbow at D90 than at D130 (all P. 0.05; left upper trapezius, 98.7%+/- 19.5% versus 132.6%+/- 16.9%; right upper trapezius, 83.4%+/- 10.6% versus 108.1%+/- 10.5%; left anterior deltoid, 94.1%+/- 12.8% versus 158.6%+/- 40.4%; right anterior deltoid, 99.1%+/- 15.0% versus 151.9%+/- 19.4%; and velocity, 0.6 +/- 0.1 m/sec versus 0.7 +/- 0.1 m/sec, respectively). Conclusion: Weight bearing on the lower extremities is significantly reduced when the upper extremities are supported during walking with an FWW-AR.

Evidence from Shanghai, China;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT;Objectives To examine whether moral hazard may exist under unsupervised home-based online applications, leading to more assistive technology devices (ATDs) and larger per capita expenditures on ATDs than under supervised community center-based online applications. Methods Using the data from the Assistive Devices Resource Centre in Shanghai, descriptive statistics were estimated for the sociodemographics of applicants. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression were used to test the effect of the introduction of home-based online applications. Results In 2015-2016, there were marked increases of 22.3% in the total number of ATDs and 27.2% in the total expenditure on ATDs compared with 2013-2014. The per capita number and expenditure also demonstrated an increasing trend. More devices were applied for in 2015-2016 than in 2013-2014, yielding a higher expenditure per capita (P < .001). Interestingly, with an invisible price, more devices were applied for at home than in community centers (P < .001), but the expenditure per capita was smaller (P < .001). Conclusions The introduction of online applications increased the number of ATDs per capita. The home-based applications induced the purchase of more ATDs but not higher expenditures on ATDs. Individuals with disabilities tend to request the maximum number of ATDs allowed by the application rules, which is an indicator of moral hazard. The prices of ATDs were not visible for individuals with disabilities, which may cause individuals to order costlier ATDs when applying at home.

The need for advancements in mobility-assistive technologies is continually growing due to advances in medicine and rehabilitation that preserve and prolong the lives of people with disabilities, increases in the senior population, and increases in the number of veterans and civilians involved in conflict situations. The purpose of this study is to survey a large sample of veterans and other consumers with disabilities who use mobility-assistive technologies to identify priorities for future research and development. Materials and Methods: This survey asked participants to provide opinions on the importance of developing various mobility-assistive technologies and to rank the importance of certain technologies. Participants were also asked to provide open-ended comments and suggestions. Results: A total of 1,022 individuals, including 500 veterans, from 49 states within the USA and Puerto Rico completed the survey. The average age of respondents was 54.3 yr, and they represented both new and experienced users of mobility-assistive technologies. The largest diagnostic group was spinal cord injury (SCI) (N = 491, 48.0%). Several themes on critical areas of research emerged from the open-ended questions, which generated a total of 1,199 comments.

The right assistive facilities and household mobility equipment are essential for everyday activities. The use of home adaptations and assistive products can maximize the quality of life for older individuals and make life more convenient for those with disabilities. This study aimed to investigate the experience of occupational therapists, using home adaptations and assistive products. An individual interview was conducted with eight occupational therapists who worked at regional hospitals and centers of excellence throughout Thailand using a qualitative study. The results were interpreted through thematic analysis. Five main themes emerged: (1) empowering independent living at home, (2) accident prevention and safety, (3) family financial constraints and barriers, (4) availability and accessibility of products, and (5) matching products with clients' capabilities and needs. Based on an occupational therapy approach, this study examines Thailand's needs for home adaptations and assistive products, as well as barriers to accessing those products and services. Through a contribution to knowledge and information based on occupational therapists' experience, the laws and regulations regarding home adaptations and assistive products for people with disabilities can be improved. Additionally, the interdisciplinary team and authorities involved in this issue should also collaborate to formulate guidelines for home adaptations and assistive products for older individuals and persons with disabilities in the future.;"Thawisuk, Chirathip/0000-0001-7650-617X; KAUNNIL, ANUCHART/0000-0002-8178-6513; Baramee, Phichaya/0009-0001-8045-2909; Thongchoomsin, Surachart/0000-0001-6190-0051; Siangchin, Supatida Sorasak/0000-0001-7981-7379; Sansri, Veerawat/0009-0002-4541-1658";1052-0147;2160-3715;;MAR;2023;28;3;;762;+;;10.46743/2160-3715/2023.5751;http://dx.doi.org/10.46743/2160-3715/2023.5751;WOS:000995375600001

Interactions and behavior were monitored to determine if behavior on the forum expressed social support, and whether the community was an entirely virtual community or a real community whose members also met in other venues. Subjects discussed in messages included technical difficulties, coping with difficulties presented by hearing loss, adjusting to assistive devices, difficulties at school and work, accessibility issues, difficulties communicating with the hearing world, and rights. Messages were also used to initiate a range of social activities. Classification of behaviors per the Social Support Behavior Code (Cutrona & Suhr, 1992) showed that most were in the category of informational support.

Key Points: A 9-year-old boy, Gross Motor Function Classification Scale level HI, was assessed over 8 ambulation trials using a posterior walker and using forearm crutches. Each trial was followed by a fine motor accuracy task. An energy expenditure index (EEI) was calculated for each device. For the posterior walker, EEI was 47% higher overall compared with forearm crutches. Fine motor accuracy and task completion time were similar for both devices. Conclusion: EEI was a straightforward method of estimating the energy costs of different assistive devices. Measurement procedures described in this case were time efficient in the field and provided a reasonable estimation of energy expenditure to help decide objectively which assistive device would best fit the needs of the student.

DESIGN: Prototype product evaluation. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Participants were 81 women with an average age of 67 years (range, 32-98 years) recruited between October 2010 and February 2012 from outpatient clinics, general practice surgeries, community continence services, and through charities and networks. METHODS: The TACT3 project developed and manufactured a prototype undergarment designed to alert the wearer to a pad leak before it reaches outer clothing or furniture. The study was conducted in 2 stages: a pilot/feasibility study to assess general performance and a larger study to measure performance, acceptability to users, health-related quality of life, and psychosocial impact. Participants were asked to wear the prototype underwear for a period of 2 weeks, keeping a daily diary of leakage events for the first 7 days. They also completed validated instruments measuring lower urinary tract symptoms, health-related quality of life, and psychosocial impact. RESULTS: On average, 86% of the time participants were alerted to pad leakage events. More than 90% thought the prototype underwear was good or OK and that it would or could give them more confidence. Mean scores for the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form indicated no change in the level of symptoms reported before or after the intervention, and no significant changes in health-related quality of life status occurred, except improvement in for travel restrictions. Evaluation via the Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale also indicated a positive impact. CONCLUSION: The prototype underwear evaluated in this study was effective and acceptable for 5 out of every 10 wearers. Findings also suggest that the prototype underwear is suitable for women of all ages, dress sizes, and continence severity.;"Cotterill, Nikki/0000-0001-6921-2712; Drake, Marcus/0000-0002-6230-2552; van den Heuvel, Eleanor/0000-0003-3603-2576; Worthington, Jo/0000-0002-2860-3511";1071-5754;1528-3976;;NOV-DEC;2015;42;6;;628;635;;10.1097/WON.0000000000000178;http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/WON.0000000000000178;WOS:000369705800008

This descriptive study assessed 14 wheelchairs used by children with cerebral palsy living in Kenya, Africa (Momentum Wheels for Humanity's Liberty II wheelchair n = 6, Beeline's Honey Bee wheelchair n = 8). Four physical and occupational therapists evaluated durability using the Wheelchair Components Questionnaire (WCQ) and functionality using the Wheelchair Interface Questionnaire (WIQ). Medians were used to compare differences in the chair types using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test in Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) 9.4 with an alpha = 0.05. Median scores on the WCQ were 8.3/10 for the Liberty II and 7.8/10 for Beeline's Honey Bee wheelchair; however, the durability of the wheel locks was lower in the Beeline wheelchair (5.1/10 compared to the Liberty II 8.1/10 (p = 0.002). Median scores on the WIQ were lower and significantly different in the area of preventing distal lower extremity pain (Liberty II =3.7/10 and Beeline = 7.6/10, p = 0.045). Low scores occurred in both chairs in the areas of transfers and transporting the chairs in the community. The Beeline wheelchairs demonstrated higher average ratings for all areas of the WIQ, indicating the wheelchairs fit the children better and were more functional for use in the home and community environment.

J;Feldner, H;Feldner, Heather;Impacts of Early Powered Mobility Provision on Disability Identity: A Case Study;REHABILITATION PSYCHOLOGY;"Background/Purpose: Providing powered mobility technology to people with disabilities is a common rehabilitation practice. However, the relationship between powered mobility introduction and identity development, when considered in the context of lived experiences of children with disabilities and their families, is not well understood. Investigating this relationship is timely given the emergence of alternative, community-based early mobility opportunities using adapted mobility toys whose impact may contrast experiences using powered wheelchairs typically provided in rehabilitation settings. Method: Using a qualitative, ethnographic case study approach, in-depth interview and field observation data were collected with 2 children and families, 1 who received a traditional powered wheelchair and the other who received an adapted mobility toy. A grounded theory approach guided the data analysis, and emerging themes were discussed until consensus was reached between Heather Feldner and families. Results: Findings revealed four themes: (1) dys/function of mobility technology; (2) daily Life, play, and participation; (3) emerging self/advocacy; and (4) complex family/industry interplay. Conclusion: Similarities and differences were present within the situated experiences of each family. Experiences were foregrounded by instances of emerging identity development throughout provision processes that were influenced by caregiver perceptions of disability (positive vs. negative), aesthetics and function (medical vs. adventure), and perceived intent of the devices (an opportunity for freedom vs. prolonging need for undesired mobility equipment). These findings highlight the varied dynamics and spheres of influence this transaction may have on the developing identity of children with disabilities, which may ultimately help inform future models of provision and rehabilitation practices. Impact and Implications This research highlights novel perspectives and experiences of very young children with disabilities and their families participating in early powered mobility provision, which offers a methodological framework for future work capturing young children's voices along with caregiver perceptions by proxy. This study applies a grounded theory framework and qualitative methodology to a rehabilitative process that has been skewed toward quantitative investigation of functional performance assessment and outcomes. By foregrounding the situated knowledge of disability, mobility, and technology experienced by children and families as a central discourse during powered mobility provision processes, this study contributes to advocacy for children who use mobility technology, by questioning how current and future design and provision can improve to positively impact their developing identities. This study helps to challenge traditional and often subconscious mobility hierarchies and advocate for the need for further education for rehabilitation professionals in areas of mobility technology provision and alternative models of disability. This work contributes to strengthening the call among rehabilitation professionals and families to advocate for policy change regarding funding and equipment justification, to allow for a broader conceptualization of early powered mobility for children, and more successful engagement with underserved populations.";;0090-5550;1939-1544;;MAY;2019;64;2;SI;130;145;;10.1037/rep0000259;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/rep0000259;WOS:000464418500004

Timely prescription of assistive devices to accommodate the rising demand has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Tele-assessment allows for continuity of care, but its success depends on therapists' acceptance. OBJECTIVE: This study examined OTs' perceptions of the feasibility of conducting tele-assessment and developing a clinical practice guideline for remote prescription of assistive devices for older adults in Singapore. METHODS: Eligible OTs were recruited from purposive sampling. Semi-structured interviews were conducted via a virtual platform (Zoom). Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis using a line-by-line coding method was used to identify common trends. RESULTS: Interviews with 10 participants revealed three main themes: (1) therapists' perceptions of the feasibility of tele-assessment, (2) criteria for safe and appropriate prescription of assistive devices via tele-assessment, and (3) practical considerations for the implementation of tele-assessment. Participants felt that tele-assessment increases efficiency with more older adults being more receptive towards technology. They also raised suggestions to address OTs' concerns regarding the safety and accuracy prescription of assistive devices following tele-assessment. This included establishing the client's suitability for assistive device prescription, characteristics of assistive devices, resources required, and considering the preferences of stakeholders involved. CONCLUSION: Tele-assessment for assistive device prescription byOTs appears feasible in Singapore. OTs should consider collaborating with other stakeholders to develop a tele-assessment clinical practice guideline for assistive device prescription.

This study explored Chinese ageing adults' expected forms and sources of future personal care and the factors influencing care expectations. A qualitative photovoice research method - which integrated photography, interviews and group discussions - was used for data collection between January and April 2016. Through purposive sampling, 36 community-residing participants aged 51-80 years took photographs that captured personal care preferences or expectations within individual, familial and societal contexts. Participants described feelings of worry, uncertainty and unpreparedness for future care needs and arrangements. They preferred practicing self-care for as long as possible and remaining in their homes and communities (ageing in place) through support from assistive technologies, family members or home-based and community services. Institutional care was regarded as the last resort. The findings reflected discrepancies between ageing adults' care preferences and realities and their ambivalent attitudes towards filial care when switching between roles. Confronted with the increasingly unreliable family care, financial resources and insufficient community services, participants anticipated receiving institutional care that would be less satisfying or that they would dislike. As caregivers, ageing adults displayed strong commitment to filial obligations, whereas when perceiving themselves as care receivers they felt that they could not expect care from their children because of practical considerations. By understanding preferred care forms and sources, actors can devote resources, policies and interventions to support self-care through proactive planning and technological advancement, foster ageing in place through family and community care, and improve institutional care to enable ageing with dignity.;"LIU, Chang/0000-0001-9760-9039; BAI, Xue/0000-0002-0502-7291; Lai, Daniel W.L./0000-0001-6365-3189";0966-0410;1365-2524;;MAY;2020;28;3;;1071;1081;;10.1111/hsc.12940;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/hsc.12940;WOS:000506307800001

Design and Methods: Cross-sectional data from six national surveys are used to compare rates of assistive device use and disability among community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older. Results: Estimates of the use of any device are similar across surveys, ranging from 14% to 18% for the population of adults aged 65 and older. However, one survey design element-the restriction of device-use questions to those reporting difficulty with daily activities-omits a potentially sizeable group: those who use devices but report no difficulty. Including this group of device users significantly increases the prevalence estimates of both device use and disability. Implications: The use of assistance and perceptions of difficulty are inextricably interwoven, and attention to the measurement of these concepts is needed. Survey designers may want to consider asking questions about assistive device use independent of questions about difficulty. In addition, researchers who study disability may want to consider including those who report using devices but no difficulty, a group that may become more prevalent as new cohorts age.;;0016-9013;1758-5341;;JUN;2005;45;3;;347;358;;10.1093/geront/45.3.347;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/geront/45.3.347;WOS:000229460500007

Currently, embryo transfer is typically conducted with the assistance of abdominal ultrasound. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of targeted nursing interventions on the embryo transfer procedure, its impact on pregnancy outcomes, and the level of patient comfort concerning bladder management throughout the procedure. METHODS: A total of 247 patients who underwent embryo transfer at the Reproductive Center of Peking University People's Hospital from December 2019 to August 2020 were included in this study. These patients were categorized into two groups: the control group (n = 124) and the experimental group (n = 123). Within the control group, patients received conventional preoperative education, whereas those within the experimental group were subjected to targeted nursing interventions. Furthermore, patients in the experimental group were furnished with explicit instructions pertaining to the volume and timing of water intake. Multiple factors were assessed in this study, encompassing bladder filling, the quality of uterine imaging, the utilization of assistive devices during the surgical procedure, and pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, a post-operative questionnaire was administered to both groups to gauge their comfort levels regarding urinary retention. RESULTS: Following the targeted nursing intervention, ultrasound scans indicated an increase in bladder depth (5.91 +/- 1.76 vs. 5.40 +/- 1.61, P = 0.02), resulting in clearer endometrial imaging (96.74% vs. 88.71%, P = 0.02). Additionally, the experimental group reported significantly higher levels of comfort with urine retention (P = 0.01) compared to the control group, and these differences held statistical significance. Furthermore, the pregnancy rate in the experimental group was greater than that in the control group (52.85% vs. 50.8%, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on the premise that pregnancy rates remain unaffected, the implementation of targeted nursing care has the potential to augment bladder filling, enhance the quality of endometrial imaging, reduce the requirement for instrumentassisted embryo transfers, and notably enhance the comfort of patients in relation to urine retention.;;0928-7329;1878-7401;;;2024;32;3;;1421;1429;;10.3233/THC-230380;http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/THC-230380;WOS:001228342100016

The role of DHTs, including telehealth, surveillance, home monitoring, and activity promotion, has expanded, becoming crucial in overcoming geographical barriers and accelerated by the recent pandemic. Physiotherapy, integral to CF care since 1946, has shifted toward patient-centered approaches, emphasizing exercise training and a physically active lifestyle. The reduction in inpatient admissions due to highly effective modulator therapies has led to increased home care and online or electronic consultations, and DHTs have revolutionized service delivery, offering flexibility, self-management, and personalized care options; however, there is a need to comprehensively understand user experiences from both people with CF and physiotherapists. This paper highlights the essential exploration of user experiences to facilitate clinician adaptation to the digital requirements of modern clinical management, ensuring equitable care in the future hospitals arena. Identifying research gaps, this paper emphasizes the need for a thorough evaluation of DHT use in CF physiotherapy education, training, and self-monitoring, as well as the experiences of people with CF with online or electronic consultations, self-monitoring, and remote interventions. Online group exercise platforms address historical challenges relating to infection control but necessitate comprehensive evaluations of user experiences and preferences. Future-proofing DHTs within the physiotherapy management of CF demands a shift toward full integration, considering stakeholder opinions and addressing barriers. While DHTs have the potential to extend physiotherapy beyond the hospital, this paper stresses the importance of understanding user experiences, addressing digital poverty, and working toward more equitable health care access. A flexible approach in the future hospital is advocated, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding of user preferences and experiences to optimize the integration of DHTs in CF care.";"Saynor, Zoe/0000-0003-0674-8477; McCann, Lisa/0000-0002-5322-5778; Kirk, Alison/0000-0002-6534-3763";;2369-2529;;;2024;11;;;;;e55718;10.2196/55718;http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/55718;WOS:001267853300001

Current objectives were to (1) survey research into difficulties people with cognitive disabilities experience when using public transit, (2) survey the current state of the art of transit and personal navigation applications (apps) and features, (3) recommend best existing transit apps for people with cognitive disability, and (4) recommend the best designs and features of these apps to developers of future transit apps. Potentially useful features were found in four categories: Transit apps for (1) individuals with cognitive disabilities and (2) healthy individuals, and personal navigation apps for (3) individuals with cognitive disabilities and (4) healthy individuals. A total of 159 apps were examined, but only seven were found specific to public transit for cognitive disability. By comparing research recommendations and currently available features, we identified several unmet needs. We note that there appears to be a shortage of apps for this population-function but that there is good research in the area and it is well suited to inform app development.;;1040-0435;1949-3614;;;2014;26;4;;209;218;;10.1080/10400435.2014.930076;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10400435.2014.930076;WOS:000344105900005

Participants were 67-year-old students who had been identified by their teachers as being relatively poor at reading. The students were divided into three groups. Two of the groups played one of the games as a supplement to normal classroom literacy instruction for five sessions per week for a period of 12 weeks. The third group formed an untreated control. Both games led to gains in reading, spelling, and phonological skills in comparison with the untreated control group. The two interventions also had some differential effects. The intervention gains were maintained at a four-month follow-up.;"Richardson, Ulla/0000-0001-9181-5106; Kyle, Fiona/0000-0003-2997-3167";0034-0553;1936-2722;;JAN-MAR;2013;48;1;;61;76;;10.1002/rrq.038;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rrq.038;WOS:000312989200005

An open-ended question was answered by 262 individuals aged 75 to 98 years living in the community. The answers were analyzed using qualitative content analysis, and differences in the categories were compared between highly and less physically active persons. Physical activity was measured according to a five-level scale. The content analysis resulted in eight categories: assistive devices, avoiding hazards, behavioral adaptive strategies, being physically active, healthy lifestyle, indoor modifications, outdoor modifications, and seeking assistance. Behavioral adaptive strategies were mentioned to a greater extent by highly active people, and indoor modifications were more often mentioned by less active older adults. Support for active self-directed behavioral strategies might be important for fall prevention among less physically active older adults.;Hellstrom, Karin/0000-0002-5789-5162;0733-4648;1552-4523;;JAN;2018;37;1;;58;78;;10.1177/0733464815624776;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0733464815624776;WOS:000417697100005

While various literature documents neural correlates to steering motion, the driver's mental state, and the impact of distraction and fatigue on driving performance, the cortical substrate of continuous deviations of a car from the road - i.e., how the brain represents a varying discrepancy between the intended and observed car position and subsequently assigns customized levels of corrective measures - remains unclear. Furthermore, the superposition of multiple subprocesses, such as visual and erroneous feedback processing, performance monitoring, or motor control, complicates a clear interpretation of engaged brain regions within car driving tasks. In the present study, we thus attempted to disentangle these subprocesses, employing passive and active steering conditions within both error-free and error-prone vehicle operation conditions. We recorded EEG signals of 26 participants in 13 sessions, simultaneously measuring pairs of Executors (actively steering) and Observers (strictly observing) during a car driving task. We observed common brain patterns in the Executors regardless of error-free or error-prone vehicle operation, albeit with a shift in spectral activity from motor beta to occipital alpha oscillations within erroneous conditions. Further, significant frontocentral differences between Observers and Executors, tracing back to the caudal anterior cingulate cortex, arose during active steering conditions, indicating increased levels of motor-behavioral cognitive control. Finally, we present regression results of both the steering signal and the car position, indicating that a regression of continuous deviations from the road utilizing the EEG might be feasible.;Pulferer, Hannah/0000-0002-1956-5322;1662-5161;;;JUN 27;2024;18;;;;;1383956;10.3389/fnhum.2024.1383956;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2024.1383956;WOS:001265555900001

These technologies are at the forefront of the integration of health and social care. However, economic evaluations of ALTs, and indeed economic evaluations of any interventions providing both health benefits and benefits beyond health are complex. This paper considers the challenges faced by evaluators and presents a method of economic evaluation for use with interventions where traditional methods may not be suitable for informing funders and decision makers. We propose a method, combining economic evaluation techniques, that can accommodate health Outcomes and outcomes beyond health through the use of a common numeraire. Such economic evaluations can benefit both the public and private sector, firstly by ensuring the efficient allocation of resources. And secondly, by providing information for individuals who, in the market for ALTs, face consumption decisions that are infrequent and. for which there may be no other sources of information. We consider these issues in the welfarist, extra-welfarist and capabilities frameworks, which we link to attributes in an individual production model. This approach allows for the valuation of the health component of any such intervention and the valuation of key social care attributes and processes. Finally, we present a set of considerations for evaluators highlighting the key issues that need to be considered in this type of economic evaluation.

Methods: Online databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles about patients' compliance with regard to lower limb assistive devices. In addition, a methodological quality control process was conducted. Studies were included if in the English language and related to compliance and adherence to the lower limb assistive device. Exclusion was based on first reading the abstract and then the full manuscript confirming content was not related to orthotic devices and compliance. Results: Twelve studies were included. The data revealed between 6% and 80% of patients were not using a prescribed device. Barriers to the use of the orthotic device included medical, functional, device properties and lack of proper fit. Strategies for improved compliance included better communication between patient and clinician, patient education, and improved comfort and device esthetics. Conclusions: Individualized orthotic adjustments, rehabilitation, and patient education were promising for increasing adherence. Despite positive aspects of improvements in gait, balance in elderly, and a sense of security produced by using assistive devices, compliance remains less than ideal due to barriers. As compliance in recent studies has not improved, continued work in this area is essential to realize the benefits of technological advances in orthotic and assistive devices.;"Bashir, Ayisha/0000-0001-7031-5559; Dinkel, Danae/0000-0002-0262-4429; Myers, Sara/0000-0002-2934-2624";0161-4754;;;FEB;2022;45;2;;114;126;;10.1016/j.jmpt.2022.04.003;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmpt.2022.04.003;WOS:000838669700003

Materials and methods: To achieve the study purpose, the researchers developed a scale, 'teachers' beliefs and professionalism', consisting of four subscales. A random sample of 157 SLD teachers participated in the study by completing the study scale and fifteen teachers were later interviewed. Results: The SLD teachers' self-reported use of AT in curriculum of children with SLD was high. The teachers' perception of their professionalism in using assistive technologies in the teaching process sub-scale had the highest mean, whereas the availability of AT had the lowest. Results revealed a statistically significant correlation between teachers' beliefs and professionalism. The results also revealed that there were no significant differences between SLD teachers according to the teachers' gender or experience level, or the level of child disability. The results showed that there was only difference regarding the availability of AT sub-scale, pertaining to public school and private school and in favour of private schools. Conclusions: Directions for further research and recommendations for policy and practice are discussed. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThere is a vital need to investigate teachers' professionalism and beliefs regarding applying AT for the children with SLD in inclusion settings, especially in developing countries.The availability of AT sub-scale had the lowest mean.The teachers' perceptions of their professionalism in using AT in teaching had the highest mean.It is hoped that this study provide the decision-makers in the Ministry of Education (MoE) with valuable insights to develop the use of AT in teaching reading and writing for the children with SLD, as well as to develop their capacities to play a crucial role to develop a new appropriate training technique for the teaches to acquire the skills in order to enrich the using of AT to enhance the children abilities to develop their mental, social abilities in inclusive schools.Provide training for teachers and the teams who work with children with SLD to match particular technologies to specific needs to help the children with SLD to be more independent.Future studies should be done to get a complete picture about the role of AT in teaching children with SLD as perceived by teachers, principals, and parents. As well as to investigate the effectiveness of using AT in developing children skills with reading and writing difficulties to motivate schools in enhancing independence of the children. Further studies should also be conducted to compare the instructional practices in the field of AT used in Jordanian inclusive schools and schools applying international programmes to benefit from their instructional practices and their effective use of AT with children with SLD in inclusive schools.;Al-Dababneh, Kholoud/0000-0001-7465-569X;1748-3107;1748-3115;;JAN 2;2022;17;1;;23;33;;10.1080/17483107.2020.1752824;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17483107.2020.1752824;WOS:000528403200001

There is growing interest in designing devices that reduce the metabolic cost of walking; however, designers lack guidelines for which joints to assist and when to provide the assistance. To help address this problem, we used musculoskeletal simulation to predict how hypothetical devices affect muscle activity and metabolic cost when walking with heavy loads. We explored 7 massless devices, each providing unrestricted torque at one degree of freedom in one direction (hip abduction, hip flexion, hip extension, knee flexion, knee extension, ankle plantarflexion, or ankle dorsiflexion). We used the Computed Muscle Control algorithm in OpenSim to find device torque profiles that minimized the sum of squared muscle activations while tracking measured kinematics of loaded walking without assistance. We then examined the metabolic savings provided by each device, the corresponding device torque profiles, and the resulting changes in muscle activity. We found that the hip flexion, knee flexion, and hip abduction devices provided greater metabolic savings than the ankle plantarflexion device. The hip abduction device had the greatest ratio of metabolic savings to peak instantaneous positive device power, suggesting that frontal-plane hip assistance may be an efficient way to reduce metabolic cost. Overall, the device torque profiles generally differed from the corresponding net joint moment generated by muscles without assistance, and occasionally exceeded the net joint moment to reduce muscle activity at other degrees of freedom. Many devices affected the activity of muscles elsewhere in the limb; for example, the hip flexion device affected muscles that span the ankle joint. Our results may help experimentalists decide which joint motions to target when building devices and can provide intuition for how devices may interact with the musculoskeletal system. The simulations are freely available online, allowing others to reproduce and extend our work.";"Delp, Scott/0000-0002-9643-7551; Hicks, Jennifer/0000-0002-2516-9334; Uchida, Thomas K./0000-0002-7700-7476";1932-6203;;;JUL 12;2017;12;7;;;;e0180320;10.1371/journal.pone.0180320;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180320;WOS:000405649600026

Ideation and concept elaboration around the introduction of a camera-based surveillance service in the homes of people with dementia, typically living alone, is explored. The paper reviews relevant literature on surveillance of people living with dementia, and summarises the findings from ideation and concept elaboration workshops, designed to capture the views of those involved in the care of people living with dementia at home. The research question relates to the ethical considerations of using assistive technologies that include video surveillance in the homes of people living with dementia, and the implications for a person living with dementia whenever video surveillance is used in their home and access to the camera is given to the person's family. The review of related work indicated that such video surveillance may result in loss of autonomy or freedom for the person with dementia. The workshops reflected the findings from the related work, and revealed useful information to inform the service design, in particular in fine-tuning the service to find the best relationship between privacy and usefulness. Those who took part in the workshops supported the concept of the use of camera in the homes of people living with dementia, with some significant caveats around privacy. The research carried out in this work is small in scale but points towards an acceptance by many caregivers of people living with dementia of surveillance technologies. This paper indicates that those who care for people living with dementia at home are willing to make use of camera technology and therefore the value of this work is to help shed light on the direction for future research.;"Bond, Raymond/0000-0002-1078-2232; Martin, Suzanne/0000-0003-2725-5495; Mulvenna, Maurice/0000-0002-1554-0785; Todd, Stephen/0000-0002-2312-9195; Hutton, Alison/0000-0002-0626-087X";1874-5490;1874-5504;;JUL;2017;10;2;;255;266;;10.1007/s12152-017-9305-z;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12152-017-9305-z;WOS:000403713400004

Chronic diseases increase the risk of physical disability, and people with physical disability experience some added risks of secondary conditions including chronic disease. Yet, little is known about the prevalence of chronic disease among women living with a physical disability who use Medicaid, a particularly disadvantaged population. Objective: This study described the prevalence of chronic disease among adult (18-64 years), female, Florida Medicaid beneficiaries living with a physical disability between 2001 and 2005. Methods: Using Medicaid eligibility and claims files, we extracted ICD-9 codes for physically-disabling conditions and Current Procedure Terminology codes for mobility-assistive devices to define three levels of physical disability. Results: Participants appeared to be at high risk for both physical disability and chronic diseases. Close to half of the women had been diagnosed with one or more physically-disabling conditions, and 5.3% used mobility devices. One-third of the women had hypertension and sizeable proportions had other chronic diseases. Women with physical disability were more likely to have co-morbid chronic diseases than their able-bodied counterparts. Discussion: Our findings support the need for improved chronic disease prevention among female Medicaid beneficiaries, particularly those with physical disability. Strategies to improve prevention, screening and treatment in this population may mitigate the trends toward higher physical disability rates in the low-income, working-age population and may prevent high Medicare and Medicaid costs in the long-run.
